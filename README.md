# React Frontend + Express Backend Template

## Description

This is a template project which demoes a ReactJs based frontend app and ExpressJs based backend server and the connection between frontend and backend using API call made with axios and the response is displayed on frontend

## Steps to run on StackBlitz
1. Fork the project
2. Open terminal and run command `npm run frontend`
3. Open another terminal and run command `npm run backend`

## How it works

In frontend the API url is generated based on the current url and by changing the url accordingly based on server port.

## Note

If frontend or backend server port is changed then changes have to be accordingly made in App.jsx to update the `API_URL` generation

## How to start from scratch

1. Create a NodeJS project on StackBlitz which will provide the terminal functionality in the Editor UI
2. Use the terminal to install the required frontend and backend libraries/frameworks
