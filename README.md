## **Milestone 33 - Implementing User Search - Frontend**

### **Overview**

Milestone 33 focuses on the frontend implementation of the user search functionality. This feature allows users to search for other users through a search input field and view search results on the frontend.

### **Topics Covered in Milestone 33**

- **User Search Integration**: Developed the frontend components and logic to enable users to search for other users and display the search results.
- **Frontend Testing**: Added test cases to ensure the correct rendering of the search input field and search results.

### **Frontend Test Cases**

The following test cases have been implemented and have passed:

- **[REQ078]_should_render_input_field_correctly**
  - Verifies that the search input field is rendered correctly on the frontend.

- **[REQ079]_should_render_search_results_correctly**
  - Ensures that the search results are displayed correctly based on the search query.

### **Running Frontend Test Cases**

To run the frontend test cases:

1. **Set Up Your Environment**

   Navigate to the frontend directory and install the necessary dependencies:
   
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Test Cases**

   Execute the test suite:
   
   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

   This command will run the frontend test cases and display the results in your terminal.

3. **View Test Results**

   The test results will indicate which test cases passed or failed. Review these results to ensure that all test cases are successful.

### **Running the Project**

To run the complete application:

1. **Start the Backend Server**

   Navigate to the backend directory and start the server:
   
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node app
   ```

   The backend server will be available at http://localhost:4000.

2. **Start the Frontend Application**
