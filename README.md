### **Overview**

Milestone 6 focuses on developing a responsive navigation bar for the application. This navigation bar ensures an optimal user experience across different screen sizes and devices.

### **Topics Covered in Milestone 6**

- **Responsive Navigation Bar**: Designed and implemented a navigation bar that adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes.
- **Frontend Testing**: Added Jasmine test cases to verify the proper rendering and functionality of the navigation links.

### **Frontend Test Cases**

The following test cases have been implemented and have passed:

- **REQ013_renders_all_navigation_links_correctly**
  - Verifies that all navigation links are rendered correctly in the navigation bar.

- **REQ012_renders_all_navigation_links_correctly**
  - Ensures that the navigation bar maintains the correct rendering of links, with accurate functionality.

### **Running Jasmine Test Cases**

To run Jasmine test cases for the frontend:

1. **Set Up Your Environment**

   Navigate to the frontend directory and install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Test Cases**

   Execute the Jasmine test suite:
   ```bash
   npx jasmine
   ```

   This command will run the Jasmine test cases and provide the results in your terminal.

3. **View Test Results**

   Jasmine will output the results of the test cases, indicating which tests passed or failed. Review these results to ensure that all test cases pass successfully.

### **Running the Project**

To run the complete application:

1. **Start the Backend Server**

   Navigate to the backend directory and start the server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node app
   ```

   The backend server will be available at `http://localhost:4000`.

2. **Start the Frontend Application**

   Navigate to the frontend directory and start the React application:
